## Principles of Good Design by Dieter Rams

Innovative: 
Good design should be innovative and push the boundaries 
of what is possible 

Useful: 
A product should satisfy certain criteria, including 
functional, psychological, and aesthetic aspects. 
Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product 
and eliminates anything that detracts from it

Aesthetic: 
The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to 
its usefulness. Well-executed objects can be beautiful 
and positively impact our well-being

Understandable: 
Good design clarifies the structure of a product and 
makes it self-explanatory. It should communicate its 
purpose effectively

Unobtrusive: 
Products should be neutral and not distract from their 
intended purpose. They should not be overly decorative 
or resemble works of art.

Honest: 
Good design does not try to manipulate or deceive users. 
It is transparent and honest about its functionality 
and purpose.

Long-lasting: 
Design should have longevity and withstand the test of 
time. It should not be trendy or short-lived.

Thorough: 
Good design pays attention to every detail and is 
meticulously crafted. It is thorough in its execution 
and leaves no room for unnecessary elements.

Environmentally Friendly: 
Design should consider its impact on the environment 
and strive to be sustainable. It should minimize waste 
and be mindful of resources.

Minimal: 
Good design is minimalistic and avoids unnecessary 
complexity. It focuses on the essential elements and 
eliminates anything that is not essential
